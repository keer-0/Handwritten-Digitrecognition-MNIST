# Handwritten-Digitrecognition-MNIST
The task is to classify a given image of handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9. The data for this project is imported from KERAS API. The dataset used is MNIST dataset.

# Convolution Neural Networks
 A Convolutional neural network(CNN) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.ConvNets have been successful in identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self driving cars.
 
 Some MAIN operaions in a CNN are:
  1.Convolution
  2.Pooling
  3.Up smapling
  4.Down sampling
  5.Fully Connected Layer
